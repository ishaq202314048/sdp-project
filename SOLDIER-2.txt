TITLE: TROOP TRACK: Soldier’s Fitness Assessment & Monitoring System

2.
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Most fitness evaluations are still conducted
manually, resulting in delayed assessments that hinder timely decision-making.
Existing manual processes also introduce frequent errors and inconsistencies,
reducing the accuracy of recorded IPFT & fitness data.
Important IPFT records are often misplaced or incomplete, creating gaps in
documentation and accountability which also creates problem during promotion.
Unit Commanding (CO) & Staff officers (Adjt, QM) face hassels to monitor
individual fitness levels, track both personal and unit-wide short & long term
progress, and identify high-risk soldiers such as those facing injury, obesity, or low
fitness.
Hassle to monitor high-risk soldiers (injury, obesity, low fitness), and plan
effective, targeted training schedules.
Absence of any notification/ alert to admin monthly or quarterly if any individual
can’t meet up certain military fitneses standard.

3.
BACKGROUND & MOTIVATION: Modern defense forces increasingly rely on
data-driven decision-making. Physical fitness directly influences soldier
survivability, performance, and mission outcome. Manual record-keeping fails to
provide real-time insights or accurate monitoring of soldiers’ physical health. A
digital fitness monitoring system ensures accuracy, efficiency, accountability, and
readiness assessment. It also can help medical officers to detect early warning
signs, trainers optimize workout plans, and commanders evaluate unitwide preparedness.

Conclusion: The Soldier’s Fitness Assessment & Monitoring System will
provide a centralized, efficient, and accurate platform to manage military fitnessrelated records. It replaces manual paperwork with automated scoring, real-time
monitoring, and data-driven decision-making. The system supports soldiers,
medical teams, and commanders through proper monitoring to ensure a fit and
capable military unit.
